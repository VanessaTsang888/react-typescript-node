# 19. Typing Standaline Event Handlers

We are going to figure out why we are getting an error msg from the `e` from when we write our onChange func at the top but not when we define the same func directly inline on the onChange prop. This is due to the type inference system in TS and how it works. 

TS has a tool called type inference to figure out what types are floating around your app. 

If we hover over the onChange prop within JSX block, we can see TS knows what type this is. It understands its a prop, and that we are required to provide some kind of callback func to it.

## type annotation

``js
// first param is `event` and the type is: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>

React.InputHTMLAttributes<HTMLInputElement>.onChange((event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void) | undefined
```

The type inference works for inline but not when we define the onChange func ahead of time. Type inference is only applied inside of JSX when we defien that callback func directly inline. How do we define the func ahead of time and still annotate the type of event object in there? 

Rename `e` to `event` and then apply a type to event like this:
Use the required type for onChange() callback and use it when we define the onChange() func at the top.
