# 23. More on Refs

Last lecture we written our `inputRef` variable.
When our component first render on screen we will focus that text input by using this `ref`. To make sure we run some code when our component first is rendered on the screen, we'll make use of the `useEffect` hook as well.

1. import `useEffect` hook at top of the component file.
2. Inside of the actual component func, above the `onClick` func, we write in `useEffect` func. Make sure the inner func is only invoked one single time, so as the second param we write an empty array. Inside the boby of this code block, we get a reference to the `inputRef` and attempt to focus it using this code: if `inputRef` is not defined then we'll return early from `useEffect`. So if we don't have a value assigned to `inputRef.current` then we don't go down any further. TS thinks we might not assign that `ref` or bind it to any actual element. This is why we had annotated the `useRef` hook and why in `useEffect` we check that the `inputRef` is defined.



3. Wire it up inside of our app component - in the index.tsx file.



## Test in UI
Now when we test in the UI, we seen the textarea is automatically focused so user can start typing inside immediately without selecting the text input. This means our component works as expected. 

### Screen shots
I've taken x2 screen shots to show my tests in the UI.
