# 18. Inline Events Handlers

***Intro***
In previous two lectures we written input element that had `onChange()` callback func's, and they were written inline so we defined the func inside the `onChange()` callback rather than separately as we did with `onClick()` func. Now, we'll define an `onChange()` callback where we define onChange itself as a separate func, rather making this change inside of our UserSearch component file. Instead we going to create a new component: `EventComponent.tsx`.

## New component file
`EventComponent.tsx`.

The type for this component is: React Function Component.
Event object abbreviated as `e`.
Error on `e`: Parameter 'e' implicity lhas an 'any' type.
We want to avoid the 'any' type for best practice - safer and less bugs.
Why we see this error here when we didn't when we had this event object within our return method statement > JSX?
