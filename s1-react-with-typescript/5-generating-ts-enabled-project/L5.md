# 5 Generating TypeScript-Enabled Projects

Generate a new react app with TS support built into it. Then develop a couple of simple components to get an idea how we use TS and react together and why we would at all.

How?
1. generate a new react project that has TS support built in.

```js
npx create-react-app <app-name> --template typescript
```
2. In our terminal run that command: `npx create-react-app rts --template typescript`
The `rts` is: react typescript.
