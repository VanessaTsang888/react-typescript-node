# File Extensions and Starting Up React

Will the file contain a React component, or any kind of JSX?
Use the extension of `.tsx`

No JSX?
Use `.ts` for redux as that dont contain JSX syntax.


Task 01:
Write a simple component and display on screen.
File name: `index.tsx`.

The code don't change as its still the code we would write to develop a React app. 

To run our app: `npm start`.
Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/
I can see the palin text displayed on the screen as expected.
