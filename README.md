# React and Typescript: Build a Portfolio Project

This is a Udemy training course that I am studying to develop my React.js, TypeScript and Node.js skills. At the sametime to develop a brand new responsive portfolio website using those technologies. To read more about this training course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-and-typescript-build-a-portfolio-project/)

## Once completed this course, I would of learnt how to:

- build a portfolio-ready project with React and TypeScript.
- simplify state updates with the Immer library.
- Manage a project using a package-based architecture.
- build an in-browser transpiler + bundler.
- Use Redux middlewares to handle complicated business logic flows.
- Integrate React and Redux together with TypeSCript.
- Understand a step-by-step process of designing and assembling an advanced project.
- Automate my deployment with the popular Lerna CLI.
- Assemble incredibly reusable React Components.
- Use Web Assembly to increase the performance of your app.

## Course Content:

27 sections | 391 lectures | 29h 18m if videos.
This is a long course. However, worth completing as I wish to reinforce and develop my current React, TypeScript, Redux and Node skills as continue learning and development is very important keeping up with the latest technologies in (FE) Software Engineering.

### How to run my project locally:

Once I have completed my responsive portfolio, you will be able to download my source code, take a look at my code base and run my website locally to test it. I will give you the instructions in how to run my website locally later when I get further into the course.


### Publish on GitHub Pages:

Once my portfolio website is completed I will publish using GitHub Pages and the url for that will be publish here. Here is the resource for GitHub Pages in case you would like to read up on the benefits: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)
