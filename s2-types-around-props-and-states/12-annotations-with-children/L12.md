# 12. Annotations with Children

***How to add other types of values to a props interface definition***

Inside of ChildProps interface, we want to communicate down some additional prop like a callback func.

Our Child component has a button inside and we want to tell the parent componenet about whenever a user clicks on those buttons.

First add in a button element to Child and ChildAsFC components. 
Then destructure out of our color props object the onClick func.
Update the interface with this callback func.
Now Parent component has error so update that file.

## Child.tsx
Content inside of Children component, React will auto provided to your component as a prop called 'children'.

## Parent.tsx
Update this file:
1. import 'ChildAsFC' rather than child. Then update our JSX.
2. This is why React.FC<>  do expect to receive a children from now.
