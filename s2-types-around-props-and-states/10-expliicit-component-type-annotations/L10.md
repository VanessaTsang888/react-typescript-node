# 10. Explicit Component Type Annotations

Explor a second way we can tell TS about a component we are creating as the way we already explored has down side to it.

```js
export const Child = ({ colour }: ChildProps) => {
  ...
};
```
Helps TS understand that Child is a func that will receive a param of type 'ChildProps', but TS doesn't understand that we are defining a React Component! There are other JS libraries that also make use of JSX. 

When we define an React Component we can assign couple of props to that component. All React Components can optionally provide these properties:
`propTypes`, `displayName`, `defaultProps`, `contextTypes`.
TS doesn't know that we're maing a React component, so it thnks that 'Child' will not have these props. We are not giving TS the full story. To fix this we going to write a different way of defining a func component with TS. 

```js
// Tell TS this is a React component. Name the component: ChildAsFC and give it type of: React.FC<...>
// The 'FC' is: function component, and pass in the interface.
export const ChildAsFC: React.FC<ChildProps> = ({ colour }) => {
  return <div>{ colour }</div>
};
```
Now can use the dot notation syntax to get props an element.
