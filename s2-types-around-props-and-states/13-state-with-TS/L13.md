# State with TS

***Objective***
Develop a party guest list that will display a list names of people who are invited to my party.

***Summary***
Collect a list of names and display them on the screen. 
To add in more names to the list we will add a text input at the bottom, and a button after it.
Will develop this app inside of one single component.

## GuestList.tsx
Inside the src directory, create new folder called state as this is just example of state but in real life we wouldn't call it state of course.

Create new component file called: GuestList.tsx

For static content, add an <input /> and a <botton></botton> right after it. Add in a piece of state to track first whatever user types into that input. A controlled input is one where we are going to designate an onChange callback and a value prop as well. So import the useState hook. Then wirer up some props in the input element by give it value of name, an onChnage we'll provide it a callback func that will receive an event object. Whenever our onChange func is called we'll update our setName piece of state. This is now a fully functioning component.

## index.tsx
Show this component inside of index.tsx file.
Inside of this file, import the GuestList.tsx component.
Inside of the JSX or the return statement, show the <GuestList /> component.
