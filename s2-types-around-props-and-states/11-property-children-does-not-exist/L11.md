# 11. Property 'children' does not exist

In the upcoming lecture, we will be making use of the children prop in our Child and ChildAsFC components. You will eventually run into the following error:

TS2339: Property 'children' does not exist on type 'ChildProps'.

React 18 introduces a breaking change with the removal of implicit children in React.FunctionComponent types.

To fix this, we now must include the children in the interface along with our other props:


```js
interface ChildProps {
  color: string;
  onClick: () => void;
  children?: React.ReactNode;
}
```
