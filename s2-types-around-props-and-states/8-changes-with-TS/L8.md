# Changes with TypeScript

When we use TS with React not too much is going to change. We are going to take a look at:

1. Applying types to component props.
2. Applying types to state in a component.
3. Types with event handlers.
4. ... Several other assorted areas.

*** Parent component ***
1. In the Parent return an instant of Child.
2. Export default Parent at the bottom.
3. Import Child from Child using a set of braces as we going to use Child as named export rather default export.

***Child component***
1. Write simple Child component that returns a simple div element that displays simple plain text.
2. Next video for the rest.
