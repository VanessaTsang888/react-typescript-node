# 33. Adding an Action Type Enum

Now we allow TS to look at each of our each cases and that action in an appropreate way. 

## Usability fix

Refactor our reducer separate out the 'action' prop from our reducer. To do this we write out a 'type' called 'Action' and paste our 3 different Actions inside of it/3 possible Actions that can be processed by our reducer. Then update the 'action' prop within our reducer func. 

## enum of ActionType

enum's are similar to an object. It contains all similar Action Types. 

### Next up
In the next lecture will separate the code in reducer file into different files and folders vased on what part of our redux side of things it actually implements.
