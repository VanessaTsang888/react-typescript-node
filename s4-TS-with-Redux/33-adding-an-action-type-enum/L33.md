# 33. Adding an Action Type Enum

Now we allow TS to look at each of our each cases and that action in an appropreate way. 
We now need to make sure we are using the Actions in an appropriate way.


## Usability fix

Refactor our reducer separate out the 'action' prop from our reducer. To do this we write out a 'type' called 'Action' and paste our 3 different Actions inside of it/3 possible Actions that can be processed by our reducer. Then update the 'action' prop within our reducer func. 

## enum of Action Type

enum's are similar to an object. It contains all similar Action Types. 

### Next up
In the next lecture will separate the code in reducer file into different files and folders vased on what part of our redux side of things it actually implements.

We will extract out the interfaces into different files and extract out the enum into a different file so we can reuse this this enum inside of other reducers easily and also make sure that we can access this inside of our different action creatures. Also will make use of the interfaces inside of our action creators too.
