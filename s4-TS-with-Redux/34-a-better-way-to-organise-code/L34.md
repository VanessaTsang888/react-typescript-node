# A Better Way to Organise Code


Create couple of different files and folders to stor our action type enum, action types etc.

## index.ts

Dir: src > state > actions index.ts

To place all of our different interfaces that describe the different kinds of actins that exist inside of our app.

## repositoriesReducer.ts reducer

Go back to our reducer, the `SearchRepositoriesAction` interface, all the way down to our type of `Action`, cut all this and past inside of the index.ts file.

Export the type `Action`. Save file.

## action-types dir > index.ts

Create new dir of 'action-types' and create new file inside it called 'index.ts'.
Inside of the reducer, cut the `ActionType` enum from the `repositoriesReducer.ts` reducer, and past inside of this new index.ts file. Also, export this.

Inside of the reducer, import `ActionType from '../action-types'`.
Also, import `Action from '../actions'`.

## Future changes

The only thing that we might want to change for this structure, as our app starts to grow, all our Action Types can be be added into this 'action-types' index.ts file. This is how we can easily expand this kind of pattern.

### Next up
Next lecture we Will do the Redux store set up. Then we will create an action creator that will be responsible for actually responsible for making that request over to the API and eventually dispatching an action of type search repositories or success or whatever else.
