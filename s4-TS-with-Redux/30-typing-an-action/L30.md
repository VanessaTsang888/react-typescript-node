# 30. Typing an Action

Write a better type annotation to the 'action' argument. Better describe what the 'action' is.
To do this write an interface called Action right above the reducer func.

Action must be an object that must have a type property. Optionally, it can have a payload.

```js
interface Action {
  type: string;
  payload?: any;
}
```
