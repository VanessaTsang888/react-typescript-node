# 26. Project Setup

This is the cmd from lecture 25 due to the fact that some breaking changes in the recent release of React v18, the versions shown in the project setup will no longer work.

`npm install --save-exact react-redux redux @types/react-redux redux-thunk@2.3.0 axios@0.21.1`

## Run the App

First install node modules using this cmd: `npm i`.
Then run the App using this: `npm start`.

I've installed the latest version of node: `nvm install node`.
