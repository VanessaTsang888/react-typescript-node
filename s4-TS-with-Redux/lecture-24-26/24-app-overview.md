# 24. App Overview

Make Redux and TypeScript (TS) work together.
Focus on the Redux side of things using a project templat that I can use in my future projects. 

## Mock up of small App I will build

See attached diagram for the design of the small app - Search Repository.
The App is going to show a simple text input to a user who then going to type in some package name and then click on the Submit button.
Then we take that search term and do a search of the NPM API. We going to find all different packages named `React`. Get all the different packages with that name or related to that name. Then print them on the screen.

To implement this, there is a lot of Redux code I need to write.

## Generate new project

Do this inside of my terminal and with this cmd: `npx create-react-app redux-ts --template typescript`.
