# 32. Applying Action Interfaces

When we receive an Action we need to satisfy one of the three interfaces.
Refactor the 'action' prop within the 'reducer' func.

Switch statements functions as type guards so we use it.

```js
    case 'search_repositories_success':
      // Since we are 100% certain that 'action' is SearchRepositoriesSuccessAction, so do this...
      return { loading: false, error: null, data: action.payload };
```
