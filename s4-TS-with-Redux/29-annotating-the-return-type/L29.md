# 29. Annotating the Return Type

Use TS to better check our code inside of our reducer - some refactoring to get to a better place.

## Apply a return type annotation to our reducer func
Simply after the closing parenthensis, we add a colon and the name of the interface which is 'RepositoriesState'.

Any time our reducer returns anything, it must matchup with our Interface.
Now if we try to change data to a Number from a String then we get an error - the data prop will become underline in red. The only thing we can assign to data is either an Array of strings or an empty Array.
