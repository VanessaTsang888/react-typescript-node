# 28. Reducer Setup

Inside of the 'src' dir create new dir called 'state' for my redux related code to live in.
Inside of 'state' dir create new dir called 'reducers'.
Inside of 'reducers' dir create new file called 'repositoriesReducer.ts'.

## The Steps

1. Define our reducer that will receive the argument of state (term) and an action that we need to process. Then we need to return some state that has these 3 props:

- data
- loading
- error

### Write Code

1. Define the reducer and assign a func to it. A func that would be called with some state and some action.
2. At the bottom, export this.
3. We can figure out what state would be as we already know that our repo reducer will return an object that has a data, loading and error props. Therefore, we write an 'Interface' that describes this state argument. Then use it to annotate the argument.
4. For action argument we just annotate as 'any' for now.
5. Inside reducer, write a switch statement.
6. currenly not taking advantage of many features of TS.

Next lecture will write more TS code.
