![dia What is a class](././dia-01-what-is-a-classs.PNG)

A class is a blueprint or model. We use it to create an object with some fields (values) and methods (func's) to represent a 'thing' or object inside of our app. 

1. how classes work with methods or func's.
2. Then add-in the idea of fields and values to them.

## Write out a new class definition 

by using the `class` keyword and then the name of the class `Vehicle` - start with uppercase letter.
Inside of the class body, we can define different methods.

We don't call the method in the calss directly. Instead we going to use a class to create an instance of a class to do so. We write the instance of a class with lower case letter.  

run the code:
`ts-node classes.ts`
