# 363. Annotations for Anonymous Functions

Annotate different types of func's:
1. An arrow func.
2. A named func.
3. An anonymous func that is assign to a variable.
We annotated all the above in the same way and we don't rely on type inference on the output part of the func since TS don't understand the logic of our code.
