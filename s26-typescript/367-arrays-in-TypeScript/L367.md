# 367. Arrays in TypeScript


***Plain JS arrays:***
- We can push elements into an array or pop elements out.
- We can map over an array, use a for-each method or a for-loop to iterate through an array.

If we want to put different types of values inside of an array we need to be very explicit about it and add in special type annotaiton.

## Examples
