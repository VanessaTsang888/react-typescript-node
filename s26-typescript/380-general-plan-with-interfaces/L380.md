# 380 General Plan with Interfaces

Diagrams:

The goal of an interface is:
- the printSummary func.
- We use the Interface to annotate the argument to that func.
- We want to use the values (the oldCivic and drink objects) with a summary func, we make sure that those values implement the reportable interface that is a summary func that returns a string. If not they can't be used with printSummary func.
- This mechanic of using an interface for gatekeeping is going to be one of the Prime ways to get some amount of code reuse inside of TS, and this strategy will be used a lot in this course.

General Strategy for Reusable Code in TS:
1. Create func that accept parameters that are typed with interfaces.
2. Objects/classes can decide to 'implement' a given interface to work with a func.
