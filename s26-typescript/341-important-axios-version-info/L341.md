# 341. Important Axios Version Information

In the upcoming lecture, we will be installing axios to use in our demo project. There is currently a major bug that has broken the last three versions of axios since v1. Until this is officially resolved, you must install the last known working pre-v1 release:

$ npm install axios@0.27.2

Done using GitBash shell.
