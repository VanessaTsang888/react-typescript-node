# 345 Catching Errors with TypeScript

I didn't actually create the bugs as the instructor did but i will continue to complete this lecture as looked at the todo/1 in the browser and knew what the properties are. If I had made the bug I wouldn't of know until I had executed the program. This is why we should write TS instead of vanilla JS.

Add in some TS syntax to catch bugs.

1. Focus on the response.data object, write some code so we can see some info about the data object.
2. Label the type of data each of those properties reference, i.e. id is a number.
3. So now define our Interface which is our first bit of TS which defines the structure of an Object. 

```js
// Define the Todo Object using TS.
interface Todo {
  id: number;
  title: string;
  completed: boolean;
}
```

Inside our app there is an Object called Todo and each will have 3 distinct properties which we know from 
looking at the object at: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1

The `response.data` is going to be one of the `Todo`. Now, TS will highlight our errors/bugs. So we saw error as soon as we defined the interface of Todo rather than when we ran the app so we can fix the bugs during development.

I've ran app again and passed.
