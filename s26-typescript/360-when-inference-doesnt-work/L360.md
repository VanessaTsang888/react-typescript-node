# 360 When Inference Doesn't Work

Variable whose type cannot be inferred correctly as TS don't understand the intent of our code. Therefore we have to annotate to tell TS that the variable of: numberAboveZero is the type-of: boolean or number.

When we need to express a single variable that possibly has different types, TS don't understand the intent of our code. Therefore, we want to annotate that variable using the OR oporator which is the pipe symbol on our keyboard.

```js
let numbers = [ -10, -1, 12 ];
let numberAboveZero: boolean | number = false;

for(let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  if(numbers[i] > 0) {
    numberAboveZero = numbers[i];
  }
}
```

Now we can assign either a boolean or a number type to the numberAboveZero variable.
