# 368 - Why Typed Arrays?

Arrays (with types).

## Plain Definition + Overview
See arrays-02.ts


## Examples
See arrays-02.ts

## Why do we care?
Pros & Cons:

1. TS can do type inference when extracting values from an array.
2. TS can prevent us from adding incompatible values to the array.
3. We can get help with 'map', 'forEach', 'reduce' func's.
4. Flexible - arrays can still contain multiple different types.
