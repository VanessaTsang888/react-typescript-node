# 361. More on Annotations Around Functions

We going to focus on how type annotations apply to functions rather than variables. So still working with types but labeling func's rather than variables.

This is type annotation for a variable called `logNumber` we written in previous letcture:

```js
/* Assign arrow func to the variable on the left. In the body of this code block, logout the value of the `i` variable declaration
** so we can inspect the UI and see the actual value. Then annotate the variable state that the value stored inside is the type of 
** a func that returns the value of void meaning this func don't return any value. */
const lgoNumber: (i: number) => void = (i: number) => {
  console.log(i)
};
```

Now we going to move to the right hand side of the equals sign, the func itself. 

- Type annotation for func: Not the variable declaration but the value we wish to store inside of the variable that is a func.
- Type interence for function: TS tires to figure out what type of value a function will return but will NOT try to figure out what type of value the arguments are.

```js
// Before annotation on an arrow func:
const add = (a, b) => {
  return a + b;
};

// After annotation the same func:
// Annotation both the params and the actual func itself.
const add = (a: number, b: number): number => {
  return a + b;
};
```
