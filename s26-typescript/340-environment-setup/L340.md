# 340. Environment Setup

Setup for our local environment.

**TS compiler:**
One time setup only. The `-g` is the global flag to install globally. I have installed this.
$ npm install -g typscript ts-node

Run compiler:
Now we installed TS we get access to the TS Compiler.
$ tsc --help

**VSCode IDE:**
I already have this installed and have been using this IDE. Therefore, I don't need to do this again.
1. Setup 'code' to path variable.
View > Command Pallete > search for: install path 
2. Install Prettier extension - a code formatter. I already have this.
3. Run Prettier on save. I don't wish to do this as I've done it before and I didn't like it.
4. Use single quotes with prettier.
5. Use two spaces for indentation.
6. Set theme to 'Solarized Light'.
