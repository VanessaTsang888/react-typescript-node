# Syntax Around Interfaces

***We can use any type inside of our interfacee***
such as object types since we not limited to primative types.

When we write an interface we list out the properties that this interface will have.
We not only limited to expressing prinitive values inside of here, we can instead express any different
type we want to inside of an intereface. Example, instead of the year to be a number, we can change that to 
have a more complex object such as an instance of a date.

A summary func that returns a string. 
Anything that wants to be a Vehicle has to have a function called summary that returns a string.
Need to update `oldCivic` object with summary() func that will return a string.

```js
interface Vehicle {
  name: string;
  year: Date;
  broken: boolean;
  summary(): string;
};
```
