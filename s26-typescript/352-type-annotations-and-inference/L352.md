Type Annotations + Type Inference are two different systems in TS.
1. Variables.
2. Functions.
3. Objects.

- Plain Definition + Overview.
- Examples.
- Why do we care?
- When to use this?

Type annotations:
Code we add to tell TS what type of value a variable will refer to.
We tell TS the type.

Type inference:
TS tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to.
We rely TS gueses the type.
