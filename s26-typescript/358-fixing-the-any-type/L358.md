# Fixing the 'Any' Type


`JSON.parse()`
coordinates variable is of type 'any' as TS can't predict what JSON func is going to return. To fix this we add in a type annotation for this variable  which is Object, as we did before - the Object literal of point. So add the overall structure of the object.

```js
const json = '{"x": 10, "y": 20}';
const coordinates: { x: number; y: number} = JSON.parse(json); 
console.log(coordinates); // {x: 10, y: 20};
```
