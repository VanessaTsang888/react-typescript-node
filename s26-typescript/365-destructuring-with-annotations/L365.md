# 365. Destructuring with Annotations

An object that describes today's weather.

```js
const todaysWeather = {
  date: new Date(), // today's date.
  weather: 'sunny'
};
```

Take today's date and just logout today's weather. Pass-in an Object literal. Mark the return type as void since we not going to return anything.

```js
const logWeather = (forecast: { date: Date, weather: string }): void => {
  console.log(forecast.date);
  console.log(forecast.weather);
};

// Call the func with the forecast object passed in.
logWeather(todaysWeather);
```

With destructuring: replace the forecast object that's in the parenthises with a set of braces and list out a list of objects I want to pull out from object. Then adject body to just date and weather. So we do the destructuring first, then the annotation after.
