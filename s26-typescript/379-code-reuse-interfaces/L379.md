# Code Reuse with Interfaces

Use the Reportable interface to describe two very different objects as those two objects uses the summary prop which is a func that returns a string. This encourages us to write generic func's such as printSummary instead of printVehicle then pass-in drink into it. This means we have a more reuseable func inside of our app.


How?
Define new object right below oldCivic object. This new object needs to have a property of summary that is a func which will return a String value using the ES6 - string interpolation syntax.

## The point of interfaces

Our oldCivic object has the summary func tied to it. Same with our drink object. These two object represent very different things inside of our app. However, they both have a summary func that returns a String. This means they both are considered to be the Reportable type (interface). So we can say the oldCivic and drink is of type Reportable. This mean we can use both of these objects with the printSummary func defined below it. This means we can call printSummary with either oldCivic or drink passed-in. 

### Conclusion
The generic printSummary func as be used with any type of object that satisfies the reportable interface.
This interface feature encourages us to write more reusable code with TS.
