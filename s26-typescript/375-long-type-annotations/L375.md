# 375 Long Type Annotations

Define an object that represents a car.
oldCivic is a Honda Civic made many years ago. In the body descript the oldCivic 
The year it was built, broken property - if this car still runs?

```js
const oldCivic = {
  name: 'civic',
  year: 2000,
  broken: true
};
```


Define a func that operates on that object.
A func that will take-in the oldCivic object and printout some properties about it. Will return nothing as just logout certain data from the vehicle object hence the void keyword which is used to obtain the undefined primitive value.
ES2015 template string, dynamically logout certain data from the vehicle object.
The type annotation (the object called vehicle) is very long. 

```js
const printVehicle = (vehicle: { name: string; year: number; broken: boolean }): void => {
  console.log(`Name: ${vehicle.name}`);
  console.log(`Year: ${vehicle.year}`);
  console.log(`Broken? ${vehicle.broken}`)
};
```

Call printVehicle and pass-in oldCivic

```js
printVehicle(oldCivic);
```

// Introduce interfaces.

/* 
The type annotation (the object called vehicle) is very long making it difficult to read. If we add more func's 
then we would be duplicating the type annotation for each of those func's. We can improve this mini program by using
an interface
