# 356 Understanding Inference

Two steps:
1. left of equals operator: Variable Declaration.
2. right of equals operator: Variable Initialisation.
3. Both together: we declare a new variable called color and assign the value red to it.

The rule with Type Inference is that if declaration and initialisation are on the same line, TS will figure out the type of 'color' for us.

TS will look at the value `'red'` and decide that color will store the value as a type-of String. This is how we get the pre-done type on the variable apples. But this will not work if we put the assignment over two separate lines. So on same line then TS will use Type Inference for us.

```js
let apples: number = 5;
```

## When do we add-in type annotation?
Type annotation:
When to use?
1. We tell TS the type that a varible will refer to:
2. When we declare a varible on one line then initialize it later.
3. When we want a variable to have a type that can't be inferred.
4. When a function returns the 'any' type and we need to claarify the value.

Type inference (TS guesses the type):
When to use?
1. Always.

We'll rely on type inference where we can but 3 scenarios where we rely on Type Annotations.
