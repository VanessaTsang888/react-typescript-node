# 364. Void and Never

No return statement as we just want to logout the message variable or object that has been passed into the logger func and is of type String. Therefore, we use the type of void as our annotation since this func will NOT return anything/no value from this func. if we accidently return something, we'll get an error msg when we hover over the red underline.

```js
const logger = (message: string): void => {
  console.log(message);
};
```

Use the type-of: never.
When we'll never reach the end of this func.
So we'll never going to execute the func completely at some point in time inside of here, we going to throw an error and exit the func early without returning any value. There is a chance we'll never reach the end of a func.

```js
const throwError = (message: string): void => {
  if(!message) {
    throw new Error(message);
  }
};
```
