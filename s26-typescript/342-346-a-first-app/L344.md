# 344 One Quick Change

Last lecture we fetched a single todo and printed out in termin but the console.log() is hard coded rather than dynamic. The data in object format is difficult to understand so we now going to fix that.

## The task
Pull out the `id`, `title`, `completed` flags and print them out in a nicer format, like a little report.

1. Get a direct reference to the `todo` which is the data property from the response object that is passed into the console.log() statement.
```js
console.log(response.data);
```

2. So pull that out and assign it to a new variable to make it easier to work with.
```js
const todo = response.data;
```

3. Pull off the  `id`, `title`, `completed` properties. Assign them to temp variables, then insert them all into a string and console.log() that string to essentially put together our report.

4. Printout as nice report using template string from ES2015/ES6 > multi-line string.

5. Run app again: $ ts-node index.ts

I have been able to run the app and have the report printed out in terminal - see my screen shot.
