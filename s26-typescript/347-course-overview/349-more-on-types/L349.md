## How Types Relate To Each Other

There is two categories of types. 

1. Primitive Types.
2. Object Types.

**Primitive Types:**
- Number, boolean, void, undefined.
- String, symbol, null.

**Object Types:**
- Functions, arrays.
- classes, objects.

### Why We Care About Types:
1. Types are used by the TypeScript Compiler to analyze our code for errors.
2. Types allow other engineers to understand what values are flowing around our codebase.
