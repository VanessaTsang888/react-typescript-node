# 339. TypeScript (TS) Overview

**What is TypeScript?**

TypeScript = Javascript + A type system.

**The TS Type System**
1. Helps us catch errors during development.
2. Uses 'type annotations' to analyze our code.
We can think of these as littel comments to describe the purpose of our code or info that's flowing through our program.
3. Only active during development.
We compile TS to get Javascript which is what we will execute since this is what the browser understands.
4. Doesn't provide any performance optimization.
No SEO at all.

**How it works**
1. Write TS code (JS with type annotations).
2. Run through TS Compiler. This is a cmd tool that's going to read our code, check it for errors.
3. Convert to plain JS code for browser.
Then take JS code, feed it into browser or Node.js and execute it. Therefore, we NEVER execute TS but JS.

**Example**
> typescriptlang.org/play
This is onlin in-browser TS to JS converter.
The left is TS code and the right is the JS equivalent.

**Summary**
- TS is same as writing JS with some extra documentation.
- TS has NO effect on how our code gets executed by the browser or Node as no Optimization.
- Think of TS as a friend sitting behind us whilst we are writting our code - helping us catch errors.
