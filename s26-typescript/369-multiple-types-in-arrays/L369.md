# 369. Multiple Types in Arrays

Continue from last lecture:
4. Flexible - arrays can still contain multiple different types. 

## Examples:
On arrays-02.ts file.

## Why do we care?
On arrays-02.ts file.

## When to use this?
Everywhere - next lecture.

### Important notes
Always annotate emtpy array to avoid the 'any type'  when we hover over the variable on the left.

```js
// Array can have the type of date OR type of string only.
const importantDates: (Date | string)[] = [];
```
