# 362. Inference Around Functions

Continue with the code block from last lecture. 
When to annotate a func:
1. Input of func: Annotation all params as no inference for params.
2. Output of func: Annotate what the func will return.

Type inference works out the output or return value, but we won't use it as if we accidently forget to write the return keyword when we write the return statement, type inference will not pick this up and we'll likely to get a bug. We know this as if we hover over the variable declaration we'll get a msg that we're not returning anything at all hence the void value within the msg. However, the code in the code body is not underlined to highlight the error. When we do annotate the output part of the func then that will be underlined in red so we know we've missed the return keyword. Therefore, although we get inference on the output we not going to use it as we'll going to add the annotation in.
